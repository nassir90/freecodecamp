			<p>Neil Postman wrote about media epistemology.
			He argued that the form of intellegence promonted by a medium is that which is required to consume this medium.
			It follows as a corollary from his theory that instant media such as the televison doesn't encourage much intellegence at all!</p>
			
			<h2>Criticisms</h2>

			<p>Despite compelling arguments on the part of Neil Postman, some would argue that the resason that society is degenerating is not a matter of transient factors such as forms of media transmission and collection, but demographics.
			Put simply, all human traits such as intellegence fall somewhere on a bell curve, and this is genetic rather than epigenetic.
			Therefore, some would say that if social groups with lower median intellegence and/or more maladaptive traits per capita are growing in number, in tandem with the rise of these "instant media" it is likeley the former that is to blame for a degenerating society</p>
