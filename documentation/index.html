<header><h2>Concurrency Multithreading and Asynchronicity</h2></header>
<p>Concurrency simply refers to doing multiple tasks at the same time, that is to say, it is equivalent to the term "multitasking"</p>
<p>As single or double thread capabilties and synchronousness and asynchronousness can be thought of as two binary properties, there are four possible means of accomplishing concurrency</p>
<ol>
<li>Single threaded, synchronous: Do one task at a time on one thread e.g. morning routine</li>
<li>Single threaded, asynchronous: Start and stop tasks for a designated reason, such as priority.
Think of a the plebian and VIP lines boarding an airplane.
There is one line, but the plebian line is stopped occasionally to allow the VIPs inside</li>
<li>Multi threaded, synchronous: Do tasks to completion on more than one thread</li>
<li>Multi threaded, asynchronous: Do #2 on multiple threads</li>
</ol>

<header><h2>CSS Is more Powerful than You Thought</h2></header>
<p>Sibling selectors in CSS enable you to do things that you may have thought required Javascript</p>
<h3>Error and Success messages example</h3>
<p>Consider a scenario in which you want to display an error message or a success message depending on what goes into an input box.
Some slow individuals may posit that one must attach an <code>onChange</code> callback to each input box, but these individuals are myopic and quite frankly, insane.</p>
<p>What one ought to do is wrap the input, the error message and the success message inside a common parent and let CSS guide the way</p>
<p>The <code>:placeholder-shown</code> pseudoclass is used as a surrogate test as to whether or not an input box is empty.
If so, use sibling selectors to set the display of both the error and success messages to <code>none</code></p>
<p>Then consider the conditions under which the error and successs messages are invisible:</p>
<ul>
<li>The error message is invisible when the contents of the input are <code>:not(:invalid)</code></li>
<li>The success message ins invisible when the contents of the input are <code>:invalid</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Simply encode this into css and you'll have yourself Javascript-less error and success indicators!!!</p>

<section id="Lambada_Calculus_and_Formal_Logic" class="main-section">
<header><h2>Lambada Calculus and Formal Logic</h2></header>
<h3>Formal Logic</h3>
<p>Formal Logic is quite interesting.
You can use it to <em>model</em> circuitboards, law and the implications of a theory.
Leraning Formal Logic also teaches you about the structure of argument, which may be of use to those who need cheap tricks to make persuasive pieces.</p>
<p>However, one shoudln't be mistaken and begin to believe that logic is the sole facet of the truth.
<em>Model</em> is the keyword here.
You may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use incorrect premises to attain a correct conclusion, and get shut down by logic obsessed individuals like yourself who don't look at emperical data</li>
<li>Use culturally accepted premises (which are actually incorrect) and then come to an incorrect conclusion (or a correct one, who knows).</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a reason we destroy people with <strong>FACTS AND LOGIC</strong> rahter than just <small></em>logic</em></small>
<p>That said, some percentage of finding truths (please God let it be small) simply comes down to luck.
You don't know whether you will be indoctrinated by Iassac Newton or CNN, and once indoctrinated, it is incredibly difficult to break the spell.
It's for this reason that I disavow the title of "skeptic".
On it's own, I would be fine with it, but as of this moment it has come to mean staunch materialism combined with a rejection of unorthodox views tauted as "conspiracy theories" - how ironic!</p>
<h3>Lambada Calculus</h3>
<p>Lambada Calculus is also interesting, as it's a turing-complete system and is actually easier to reason with than whith turing machines.</p>

<section id="Width_100" class="main-section">
<header><h2>Width 100</h2></header>
<p>Don't use <code>width:100%</code> for headers.</p>
<p>Instead, use <code>position:absolute/fixed</code> comnined with <code>left: 0px; right: 0px; top: 0px;</code>.
Thank me later</p>

<section id="Systemd_Systemctl_and_Service" class="main-section">
<header><h2>Systemd Systemctl and Service</h2></header>
<p>Systemd is the papa process.
It's the daemon run with PID=1, and is used as a replacement for SysV which itself was a tool for managing services</p>
<p>Systemctl is the management program provided directly by systemd</p>
<p>Service is a wrapper around service managing programs, and may use systemctl if it is available.
Of course, as a wrapper, it has less functionality than systemctl itself<p>
<p>Use systemctl for specificity and service in scripts for cross-compatibility</p>
